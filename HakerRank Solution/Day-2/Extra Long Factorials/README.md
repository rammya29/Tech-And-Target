# Extra Long Factorials

## Description

The factorial of the integer n, written n!, is defined as:

Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

For example, if n = 30, we calculate 30 X 29 X ... 3 X 2 X 1 and get 2652528598121910586363084000000 .

Function Description

Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.

extraLongFactorials has the following parameter(s):

n: an integer

> Note: Factorials of n > 20 can't be stored even in a 64-bit long long variable. 
> Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, 
> but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.

**Input Format**

Input consists of a single integer n.

**Constraints**

1 < n < 100
